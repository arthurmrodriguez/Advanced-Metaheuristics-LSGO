This project contains the C++ and MATLAB/Octave implementation of the
DG2 algorithm. 


-----------
Known Bugs:
-----------

The MATLAB implementation has only been tested with GNU Octave version
4.0.0. The program may result in syntax error in MATLAB; however, with
some minor changes it can be easily ported to MATLAB. This portability
issue will be fixed in the near future.

The C++ implementation has not been fully tested. For more information
please see README file specific to each implementation.
