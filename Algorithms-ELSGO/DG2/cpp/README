This is the C++ implementation of the DG2 program.

-----
Notes
-----

* This is a pre-alpha release. Some features are still missing and the
  program may contain bugs. Please report bugs to Mohammad Nabi Omidvar
  (mn.omidvar@gmail.com).

* Missing Features: Although the core functionality of the DG2 is complete,
  the save and load functions are not fully implemented. Only the Theta
  matrix is written as an ASCII file so that the groups can be inferred.

* Known Bugs: The output of the C++ implementation does not fully match
  that of MATLAB/Octave. Part of the reason might be due to discrepancies in
  the benchmark data files of the two implementations. In the MATLAB/Octave
  implementation the files are written in binary format whereas the
  CEC'2013 uses textual data files. The precision of data files for the C++
  implantation of CEC'2013 benchmarks has been increased by regenerating
  the files from the MATLAB data files using a larger number of significant
  digits (as compared to the original implementation). This increase in
  precision eliminated some of the differences between the C++ implementation
  and MATLAB/Octave implementations; however, some differences remain and
  it is unclear whether these are due to bugs and logical errors in the
  C++ implementation or due to discrepancies in the benchmarks. Further
  investigations are needed to find the source of discrepancies.

How to Compile and Run
----------------------

In Linux:
$ make
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
$ ./dg2 [space separated list of functions to run]


-------------------------
How to Analyze the Output
-------------------------

The analysis program has been adopted from the MATLAB/Octave
implementation. These include the following files:


 - analyze2013.m
       these functions can be used to analyze the output of differential
       grouping. Their output contains information about the number of
       non-separable groups, number of separable variables, the total
       evaluations needed, and the grouping accuracy as measured by the
       rho-metrics (see [3]). A sample output of this program and its
       explanation is given later in this file.
               
       USAGE: analyze2013([1:15], './results/', '../MATLAB/cec2013');

 - findConnComp.m
       an implementation of the connected components algorithm to form
       the groups based on the Theta matrix generated by DSM. This is used
       internally by the dsm.m.

 - rho_metrics.m
       this function takes the ideal Theta matrix and the one generated
       by DG2 to calculate the rho-metrics. See [3] for more details about
       this metric.

This table shows how each group of non-separable variables discovered
by differential grouping is formed. Each column represents a permutation
group as defined in the CEC'2010 or CEC'2013 suites. Each group contains a
predetermined set randomly chosen decision variables. Each row shows the
size of the groups formed by DG2 as well as the permutation groups the
variables belong to. For example G03 is the third group formed by DG2 and
it contains 25 decision variables which belong to the last permutation group.
