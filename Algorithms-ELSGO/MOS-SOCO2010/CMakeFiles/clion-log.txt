CMake Warning (dev) at gaedaexec/CMakeLists.txt:11 (link_directories):
  This command specifies the relative path

    ../gaeda

  as a link directory.

  Policy CMP0015 is not set: link_directories() treats paths relative to the
  source dir.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0015" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
