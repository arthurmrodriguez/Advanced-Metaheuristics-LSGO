This is the C version of BBOB challenge program, Beta version 0.9
    --- http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2009 ---

It is meant to be used with any ANSI C compliant compiler.
It was tested using with GCC 4.2 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu3 and Mandriva 4.2.3-6mnb1) and MingW gcc 3.4.5

As usual, this software comes with absolutely no warranty (see Warranty at end).

It is here assumed that you know what BBOB is about, and that you have read the corresponding documentation. Otherwise, you can fetch it from  the BBOB web site at http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2009-downloads

Installation
============
If you are reading this, you already succeeded in unpacking the BBOB tar file :-)

After untaring the archive, the BBOB directory should contain the following files:

bbobStructures.h
benchmarks.c
benchmarksdeclare.c
benchmarksdeclare.h
benchmarksinfo.txt
benchmarks.h
benchmarkshelper.c
benchmarkshelper.h
benchmarksnoisy.c
benchmarksnoisy.h
createfolders.py               creates the output folder structure
createfolders.tar.gz           contains an empty output folder structure
dirOK.c
dirOK-linux.c
exampleexperiment.c    
exampleexperiment.out
examplenoisyexperiment.out     example console output when everything goes well
exampletiming.c
fgeneric.c
Makefile
MY_OPTIMIZER.c
README

At Unix prompt, simply type "make" and two executable files should be compiled:

* exampleexperiment - that launches a very quick but complete experiment using the random MY_OPTIMIZER.c optimizer (see code). The output should match the file exampleexperiment.out, set srand correctly to have the exact same figures though.

* exampletiming - that launches the timing experiment (warning, this program takes at least half a minute before the first output to console, be patient :-)

Before you can run the examples, you will need to create a folder/subfolder structure. The whole folder/subfolder structure is in the archive createfolders.tar.gz which, when untarred, outputs the folder PUT_MY_BBOB_DATA_PATH. This folder must be renamed to match the data path of your experiment. An alternative scripted way for generating the folder structure is given below (see Python folder creation).

For instructions on installing Python, please refer to the software user documentation found on our download page: http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=bbob-2009-downloads

If compilation fails, or some run-time error appears when running either of those programs, get in touch immediately with bbob@lri.fr indicating all information about your system and compiler, as well as the complete error message(s).

Customization
=============
you might at some point want to try your own optimizer: this is fairly easy, assuming you know how to write C code and how to modify a 'flat' Makefile.

1- edit exampleexperiment.c and replace the strings "PUT_..." with the correct names. If you modify the 'PUT_MY_BBOB_DATA_PATH' string, you need to run the createfolder.py python script with the corresponding new string, see above.

2- write a MY_OPTIMIZER.c function (in MY_OPTIMIZER.c file) that sets up everything for your optimizer, and calls it with the correct arguments

3- in case your optimizer does not use a function pointer in its calling arguments, you can directly use the objective (fitness) function 

double fgeneric_evaluate(double *);

which remains the same for all benchmark functions. The function declaration can also be found at the end of file bbobStructures.h 

4- Modify Makefile so that all the files that are needed by your optimizer are compiled, and linked with exampleexperiment.o

You're done :-)

In case of problem, send a mail to bbob@lri.fr but please make sure first that your optimizer runs smoothly as a standalone application.

Linux/Unix Users
================
To skip the step of creating the folder structure with the createfolders.py module you need to compile the dirOK-linux.c file and link to dirOK-linux.o instead of the dirOK.o object file. To do so, you need to edit the Makefile that we provide and change the setting of variable DIROK.

Python folder creation
======================
Before you can run the examples, you will need to create a folder/subfolder structure. The python module createfolders is provided to generate the whole folder structure necessary for fgeneric to work. To generate folder PUT_MY_BBOB_DATA_PATH (of course any other name can be used, if you modify exampleexperiment.c accordingly) and the necessary folder structure in the current working directory, type from a command-line: 
    python createfolders.py PUT_MY_BBOB_DATA_PATH
or from the python command-line use the commands:
 >>> import createfolders
 >>> createfolders.main("PUT_MY_BBOB_DATA_PATH")
