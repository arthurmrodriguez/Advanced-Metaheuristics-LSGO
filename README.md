This repo contains my Computer Engineering Degree's Final Project, studied at the University of Granada, Spain. The main focus is to apply state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms into a **Big Optimization** problem with thousands of variables.
Our task is to find out how accurate are theoretical benchmark results compared to real EEG (Electroencephalography) data
