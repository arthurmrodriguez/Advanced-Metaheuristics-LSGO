# UGR-GII-TFG

This repo contains my Computer Engineering Degree's Final Project, studied at the University of Granada, Spain. The main focus is to apply state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms into a **Big Optimization** problem with thousands of variables.
Our task is to find out how accurate are theoretical benchmark results compared to real EEG (Electroencephalography) data 

This research is directed by Ph.D. Daniel Molina Cabrera.

## The set of algorithms that will be compared are the following:

### 1. MOS-SOCO2010
Multiple Offspring Sampling hybrid-based algorithm that combines a Differential Evolution Algorithm (DE) with a powerful Local Search (LS), the MTS-LS1. This algorithm was proposed for the SOCO 2010 by A. LaTorre, S. Muelas, J.M. Pe√±a.
